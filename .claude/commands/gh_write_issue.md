claude code "DO NOT IMPLEMENT ANYTHING. DO NOT MODIFY ANY CODE FILES.

Read CLAUDE.md and architecture.md. For: $ARGUMENTS, ONLY create a GitHub issue (do not implement the feature/fix).

Generate and execute 'gh issue create' with:
- Detailed title
- Problem/feature description with architecture context
- Affected components and files (mention file paths but don't modify them)
- Technical considerations
- Suggested implementation approach (describe in words, no code changes)

Auto-detect type (feature/bug/improvement) and add labels 'back' + detected type.

Your job ends after creating the issue. Do NOT write any code or modify any files."
